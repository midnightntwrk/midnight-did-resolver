# DID Manager Service

The DID manager is a single-user Node.js web application for wallet preparation and Midnight DID lifecycle operations.

## Scope

- prepare funding using the same shared seed used for DID ownership
- start sessions and persist local profiles
- explicitly close wallet/runtime sessions to release resources before profile or flow changes
- expose current NIGHT / tNIGHT and DUST balances for the active wallet session
- manage local secret storage independently from DID publication
- sign and verify detached payloads against Midnight DID verification methods
- deploy or join a DID contract
- manage verification methods, relations, services, aliases, and deactivation

## Main pages

- `/wallet`
- `/secret-storage`
- `/signatures`
- `/did`
- `/docs`

## User flow

```mermaid

  [*] --> Wallet
  Wallet --> FundingPrepared : prepare funding
  FundingPrepared --> SessionReady : start session
  SessionReady --> Wallet : close session
  SessionReady --> SecretStorage : open /secret-storage
  SecretStorage --> Signatures : open /signatures
  SessionReady --> DidPage : open /did
  SecretStorage --> DidPage : select local key for DID operation
  DidPage --> Signatures : verify with DID method
  DidPage --> DidPage : deploy/join/update
  DidPage --> Deactivated : deactivate
```

## Main configuration

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `DID_MANAGER_SETUP` | Runtime setup: `standalone`, `preprod`, or `mainnet` |
| `DID_MANAGER_HOST` | Bind host |
| `DID_MANAGER_PORT` | Bind port |
| `DID_MANAGER_DATA_DIR` | Persistent local data directory |
| `DID_MANAGER_SESSION_FILE` | Optional explicit session file path |
| `DID_MANAGER_SECRET_FILE` | Optional explicit secret store file path |
| `DID_MANAGER_SECRET_PASSPHRASE` | Secret store passphrase; required for `preprod` and `mainnet` |
| `DID_MANAGER_LOG_FILE` | Log output file |

## Run

```bash
npm run dev -w @midnight-ntwrk/midnight-did-manager-service
./start-manager.sh
./start-manager.sh --preprod
./start-manager.sh --mainnet
```

`--preprod` and `--mainnet` default to public `/api/v4/graphql` indexers.
`--mainnet` defaults to local proof server (`http://127.0.0.1:6300`) and has no faucet; operators should use the funded Midnight Wallet seed.

## Runtime hardening

Mutating API routes run through a single-flight operation store. Runtime wallet/session state is serialized inside `ManagerRuntimeState`, and unlock startup is generation-guarded so stale wallet contexts cannot attach after a newer lock or unlock begins.

DID-based detached verification also checks that the requested verification method is bound to the DID returned by the resolver before checking the signature. `preprod` and `mainnet` manager profiles require `DID_MANAGER_SECRET_PASSPHRASE`; only standalone mode uses the development fallback.
